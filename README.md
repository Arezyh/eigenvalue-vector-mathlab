<h1>Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This MATLAB program is designed to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix provided by the user. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra and have various applications in mathematics, science, and engineering.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure your input matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns (N x N).</li>
    <li>Input your matrix using square brackets and semicolons to separate rows. Here's an example for a 2x2 matrix:
        <pre>
[3 0; 8 -1]
        </pre>
        And for a 3x3 matrix:
        <pre>
[0 0 -2; 1 2 1; 1 0 3]
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The program starts by taking the user's input for the matrix.</li>
    <li>It then converts the input into a MATLAB symbolic matrix for calculations.</li>
    <li>The program verifies if the input matrix is square (m x n must be the same).</li>
    <li>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated using built-in MATLAB functions.</li>
    <li>The results are displayed, showing the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The eigenvalues are shown as a list.</p>
<p>For each eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector is displayed.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Eigenvalues represent how a matrix scales eigenvectors, and they have applications in various fields, including physics and engineering.</li>
    <li>Eigenvectors are the directions that remain unchanged when transformed by the matrix.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy using this MATLAB program for eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations!</p>
